# Step 2 check

Command, run from the repository root with `SYSMLV2_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/spike1-toolkit/cache` set to a
writable directory (the default `~/.cache` is read-only in this environment):

```
sysmlv2 check --strict --lib /tmp/spike1-sysml-release/sysml.library \
  spike/model/profile.sysml spike/model/pump-library.sysml spike/model/pump-system.sysml
```

Output: none on stdout or stderr. Exit status 0.

## Model contents

`spike/model/profile.sysml`: the stand-in profile, three `metadata def`s (`Component`, with the
required `bearer` feature mirroring decision 0005; `Interface`, mirroring decision 0006; `Process`,
mirroring decision 0007) and the `BearerKind` enumeration.

`spike/model/pump-library.sysml` (added at step 5, OQ4: definitions belong in a library package):
the pump system's definitions. `spike/model/pump-system.sysml` imports it and holds only the
usages, requirements, and satisfy/verify relationships below.

A pump system with

- 5 part definitions: `PumpSystem`, `Pump`, `Controller`, `PressureSensor`, `Enclosure`, each
  carrying `@Component`.
- 2 interface/port definitions: `PowerPort` (`port def`) and `DataLink` (`interface def`), each
  carrying `#Interface`.
- 1 action definition: `MonitorPressure`, carrying `#Process`.
- 6 requirements, each with a declared short name (`REQ-001` to `REQ-006`): `MaxPressure`,
  `ResponseTime`, `PowerDraw`, `DataLatency`, `EnclosureRating`, `StartupTime`.
- 6 `satisfy` claims, one per requirement, naming `pumpSystemUnderTest` or one of its parts as the
  satisfying element.
- 1 verification case (`PumpSystemAcceptance` def, `pumpSystemAcceptanceTest` usage) with a
  `verify` relationship for each of the two requirements it covers (`MaxPressure`, `ResponseTime`).

Spike 2 step 2 brought `profile.sysml` in line with decisions 0005 to 0007's accepted textual
forms (an open `attribute def BearerKind` instead of the enum, `Interface` applying to usages and
`individual` defs, not definitions only) and added one element per new case to the pump model:
`EmbeddedController` (a two-valued `bearer = (material, information)`), `ThirdPartyModule` (bearer
value `thirdPartyBinary`, declared in `PumpLibrary` rather than the profile), and
`ControllerSensorLink` (an `individual interface def` specializing `DataLink`) with its usage
`controllerSensorLink`. `check --strict --lib` (command below) still passes after the addition.

Step 4 added declared short names to the five component usages (`CMP-SYS`, `CMP-PUMP`, `CMP-CTRL`,
`CMP-SENS`, `CMP-ENCL`): decision 0005 requires a short name on an element carrying the Component
stereotype, and the orphan-components query needs one to report. `check --strict` still passes
after the addition; the command above was re-run to confirm it.

## Public model

`sysml/src/examples/Geometry Examples/SimpleQuadcopter.sysml` in the SysML-v2-Release clone at
`/tmp/spike1-sysml-release/`, used for step 3's second graph and measurement M2. The Annex A
`SimpleVehicleModel.sysml` was tried first and rejected: `sysmlv2 check --lib` reports 17 errors
against it (ambiguous references such as `ignitionCmdPort` and `vehicleToRoadPort` resolving to
multiple memberships), a toolkit/spec-vintage mismatch unrelated to this spike. `SimpleQuadcopter.sysml`
and three validation-suite files (`1a-Parts Tree.sysml`, `8-Requirements.sysml`,
`2a-Parts Interconnection.sysml`) were tried and all pass `check --strict --lib` cleanly;
`SimpleQuadcopter.sysml` was kept because it has part definitions, ports, and connections.
