# Status

State of the project as of 2026-10-08. The session that changes the project's state updates this file before it ends; [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the rules that do not change from session to session.

## Phase

Design, with a package skeleton. The repository holds decision records, open questions, plans for the profile and for the adopter's capabilities, five thread queries, a graph contract skeleton, and a `weft` package with no functionality beyond its version. CI builds the sysml-toolkit wheel at the pinned commit and runs the tests on Linux and Windows for Python 3.11 to 3.13.

## Settled

| Decision | Content |
|---|---|
| [0001](docs/decisions/0001-git-is-the-record.md) | SysML v2 textual notation in git is the record. Flexo MMS is an optional one-way mirror (tier 1), and every core feature works at tier 0 without a server. |
| [0002](docs/decisions/0002-sysml-toolkit-for-parsing-and-checking.md) | sysml-toolkit parses, checks, and converts to and from SysML v2 API JSON. |
| [0003](docs/decisions/0003-holonic-for-graph-organization.md) | holonic organizes the derived graphs, one holon per model version. |
| [0004](docs/decisions/0004-python.md) | Python, 3.11 or later. |

## Proposed

| Decision | Content |
|---|---|
| [0005](docs/decisions/0005-component-stereotype.md) | Component is a role. A required, open `bearer` list records whether a material artifact bears it, an information content entity's concretization does, or a project-declared kind does. Accepted 2026-10-08. |
| [0006](docs/decisions/0006-interface-stereotype.md) | Interface applies to definitions and usages. Without `individual` they are specifications (directive information content entity). With `individual` they are realized connections (material entity) linked to the specification they specialize. Accepted 2026-10-08. |
| [0007](docs/decisions/0007-action-definition-stereotype.md) | The `action def` stereotype is named Process and aligns to BFO process, because CCO's Function is a disposition. Accepted 2026-10-08. |

## Open work

| Item | Location | State | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adopter capabilities | [docs/plans/adopter-capabilities.md](docs/plans/adopter-capabilities.md) | Drafted; four of five questions answered | Verify the three Kotar points under OQ11 with a model edited in Kotar. Decide in the profile work whether a user story is a use case or a requirement with a stakeholder |
| Buildability review | [docs/reviews/2026-10-08-buildability.md](docs/reviews/2026-10-08-buildability.md) Items 1 to 5 and 7 closed in [zwelz3/weft#7](https://github.com/zwelz3/weft/pull/7): license, pins, package and CI, decisions 0005 to 0007, thread queries, and the upstream issue draft | Apache-2.0 is adopted (2026-10-08). Item 6 is spike 1, filed as [zwelz3/weft#8](https://github.com/zwelz3/weft/pull/8). Item 8's offline check is `tests/test_status.py`; the check against live issue state is not written |
| Data for the spike | [zwelz3/weft#1](https://github.com/zwelz3/weft/issues/1) | Requested | The maintainer supplies a component, an instance table, trace data, and an adapter ontology excerpt |
| Spike 1 | [zwelz3/weft#2](https://github.com/zwelz3/weft/issues/2) | Not started | Run against a public model from SysML-v2-Release at the pinned commit. Step 4 uses the five queries in [queries/](queries/). The deliverable is [docs/graph-contract.md](docs/graph-contract.md), now a skeleton |
| Profile | [docs/plans/profile-brief.md](docs/plans/profile-brief.md) | Stereotype decisions 0005 to 0007 accepted 2026-10-08; the brief's rows are filled | Start the requirement stereotype |
| Report to sysml-toolkit maintainers | [docs/outreach/sysml-toolkit-rename-stable-identity.md](docs/outreach/sysml-toolkit-rename-stable-identity.md) | Drafted, not filed | The maintainer files it on Open-MBEE/sysml-toolkit before any sidecar-map code is written (OQ2) |
| Report to Flexo maintainers | [docs/outreach/flexo-sysmlv2-rdf.md](docs/outreach/flexo-sysmlv2-rdf.md) | Drafted and reviewed, not filed | The maintainer files it on Open-MBEE/flexo-mms-sysmlv2 |
| holonic enhancements | [#51](https://github.com/zwelz3/holonic/issues/51), [#52](https://github.com/zwelz3/holonic/issues/52), [#53](https://github.com/zwelz3/holonic/issues/53) | #30 and #50 merged to holonic `main` in [zwelz3/holonic#54](https://github.com/zwelz3/holonic/pull/54), with two defects found during that work fixed in [zwelz3/holonic#56](https://github.com/zwelz3/holonic/pull/56); not yet released | Until holonic 0.9.0 is released, Weft pins holonic `main` at `25d1c84` (decision 0003), the merge of #54; #56 landed after that pin. #52 after spike step 7, which supplies its two-version fixture. #51 and #53 deferred: the adopter needs no cross-source identity yet, and Kotar works against git rather than Flexo |

The design questions behind this work are in [docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) (OQ1 to OQ13).

## Findings that are easy to rediscover

- The toolkit's Python package is named `sysmlv2`, and that name on PyPI belongs to an unrelated placeholder project. The bindings are built from source (decision 0002).
- Flexo's per-ref SPARQL endpoints choose the dataset only for queries that name no graphs, and holonic's layer reads use `GRAPH` patterns ([zwelz3/holonic#53](https://github.com/zwelz3/holonic/issues/53)).
- holonic validates the union of a holon's interior graphs, so two model versions cannot share a holon (OQ3).
- Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` when no `CLAUDE.md` exists in the working directory or above it (v2.1.277 or later). Adding a `CLAUDE.md` to this repository stops that unless the new file imports `@AGENTS.md`.

## Working conventions

The maintainer pushes directly to `main` while the project is in design; contributions arrive as pull requests on this repository, stacked when one depends on another. Commits are authored by the maintainer, and agents add no AI attribution to commits or to pull request bodies (AGENTS.md rule 11). Documents are drafted with the `better-language-skill` skill.
